# Some notes not to forget
Here is some useful notes which I would like to save.

### Vue router
- `$route` - referes to the single current route we are currently in.
- `$router` - referes to the entire navigation history.

Every instance of Vue component has access to the route and the router by `this.$route` and `this.$router`.
